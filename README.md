# The Odin Project: Weather App

## Description

This project uses an open weather API and async/await to make a weather app. A user may input their location to receive a custom weather forecast. This project was an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)'s Javascript/API lessons.
